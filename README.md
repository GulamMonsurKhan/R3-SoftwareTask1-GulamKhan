This project works by adjusting the potentiometer. The potentiometer acts as a voltage divider. When adjusted, the wiper position determines the output voltage.
Two CD4511 decoders are used to send 2<sup>n<sup> outputs. From the Arduino, 4-bit binary outputs are sent to the decoder which is then sent to the seven segment displays. 
The respective LED's are then lit up. The potentiometer ranges from 0-99.
